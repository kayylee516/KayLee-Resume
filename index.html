        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Kay Lee and I am currently studying psychology at UCR. I am a Korean American born May 16, 2001 in Yonkers, New York. At a young age, I moved to California and ended up spending most of my life residing in Chino Hills. There, I attended Ruben S. Ayala High School. Academically, I wanted to explore subjects and diverse areas of knowledge as I was still unsure of my desired career path. I took AP classes including European History, English Language and Literature, United States History, Calculus, Biology, and Psychology. Although I relatively enjoyed most classes, psychology was the first class I was thoroughly and genuinely interested in. It became one of the few subjects I was passionate about and therefore, it became my decided major. Outside of academics, my main extracurricular was marching band and concert band. I played flute and performed in the wind ensemble, or the highest level ensemble for two years. However, besides concert band, marching band was an extreme dedication. There were 3-4 hour practices almost every weekday along with longer practices or competitions on the weekends. Our marching band was recognized as top in the state and even earned the title of first in Utah competitions. Additionally, the Ayala BAC was acknowledged as one of the top in the nation. In addition to band, I was also involved in a variety of clubs. At Leo club, I dedicated over 60 hours of volunteer work. This was accumulated over the course of many different events, and each of them proved to be a refreshing and enlightening experience. I was able to get a taste of the work field in some events, support cancer patients in another, and even tutor elementary children. I was also involved in leadership positions in both Chemistry club and Write-A-Way club. As a secretary in Chemistry club, I kept the club running smoothly, being in charge of things such as tracking hours of members. As a club, we focused on cultivating a passion for chemistry and making it an interesting yet educational experience for members. As an officer in Write-A-Way club, we provided aid for students in need of revision or guidance in essays. Additionally, we provided opportunities for students with a passion for writing in competitions and events. Although these were the main clubs I was involved in, I was also in Korean club, Filipino Student Union, and National Honors Society. Outside of school, I was also a part of the Diamond Youth Symphony Orchestra for two years. There were five hour practices once a week regularly and twice a week before events. As an orchestra, we would volunteer and perform at charity events, for patients in hospitals, and for the homeless. As a musician who had been playing the flute since fifth grade but only ever performed for generally parents, being a part of this orchestra volunteer organization was extremely rewarding. I was able to make others happy while simultaneously doing what I loved.
